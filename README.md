## General Info
This project was a semester-long assigment for my Database Design class, instructed by Professor Thomas McKee.
The topic of choice was inspired by my love of history, and I consulted Professor Andrea Gatzke, a former history professor of mine, to establish the business rules for the database.

This Julio-Claudian family tree database is meant to be an educational tool for all skill levels. It assumes very little prior knowledge of Roman history and customs, so students and the general public can quickly learn through simple queries. Seasoned historians and professors are not forgotten; though this database does provide tables on Julio-Claudian members and their relationships such as marriages and personal information, it also provides a timeline of their time in public office, involvement in famous events, and their depictions on famous artifacts, statuary, monuments, and paintings. 

Sample queries are available in the project-report.pdf.
